This app was made while reading a [tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html#designing-the-application-state-tree)
but I merged client and server app together

To test:

1. `npm start` to start app.
2. Visit `http://localhost:3333/` to vote (reload page and vote again).
3. Visit `http://localhost:3333/#/results` to view results.


Directory structure:

* `client` -- code that is used by client,
* `server` -- code that is used by server,
* `public` -- public folder, all assets fetched from here.
